    description: 'Utopia Beach Club is the culmination of the vision and passion of our beloved late father Serag Saad Hwaidak. The son of Saad Hwaidak whom along with his brother Mohamedy Hwaidak famously founded the first hotels in Hurghada, North Red Sea, in the1980’s. Once just a small fishing village Hurghada is now one of the most popular tourist destinations in the whole of Egypt. Utopia began its life in 1994 as “The Floating Hotel” anchored off the shore of Utopia Beach whilst the traditional buildings and rooms of the original hotel were constructed. As the first person to consider building in the Quseir area our father was able to locate the very best bay in the area for diving. Before long this bay gained a reputation amongst serious divers as a place of outstanding natural and marine beauty with an abundance of coral and underwater life. Offering guests a peaceful haven away from the hustle and bustle of the North Red Sea Utopia swiftly gained a reputation as the ideal destination for sunbathers, snorkellers and divers alike. Utopia Beach Club is a family managed beach hotel located on the shores of the South Red Sea in Egypt. It offers a sandy beach, a house reef, diving and snorkelling activities.  All the rooms at Utopia include a terrace with a garden view. Each one offers a satellite TV, outdoor furniture and a fridge. The bathroom is fitted with a bath or a shower.  Guests can enjoy an energizing workout at the gym, followed by relaxation time at the spa. An array of activities can be enjoyed at the property including tennis and darts.   This resort is 47 km from Marsa Alam International Airport.  An airport is available upon request.&nbsp;<br/><b>Disclaimer notification: Amenities are subject to availability and may be chargeable as per the hotel policy.</b>'
