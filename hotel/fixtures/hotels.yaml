    description: 'Utopia Beach Club is the culmination of the vision and passion of
      our beloved late father Serag Saad Hwaidak. The son of Saad Hwaidak whom along
      with his brother Mohamedy Hwaidak famously founded the first hotels in Hurghada,
      North Red Sea, in the1980’s. Once just a small fishing village Hurghada is now
      one of the most popular tourist destinations in the whole of Egypt. Utopia began
      its life in 1994 as “The Floating Hotel” anchored off the shore of Utopia Beach
      whilst the traditional buildings and rooms of the original hotel were constructed.
      As the first person to consider building in the Quseir area our father was able
      to locate the very best bay in the area for diving. Before long this bay gained
      a reputation amongst serious divers as a place of outstanding natural and marine
      beauty with an abundance of coral and underwater life.

      Offering guests a peaceful haven away from the hustle and bustle of the North
      Red Sea Utopia swiftly gained a reputation as the ideal destination for sunbathers,
      snorkellers and divers alike. Utopia Beach Club is a family managed beach hotel
      located on the shores of the South Red Sea in Egypt. It offers a sandy beach,
      a house reef, diving and snorkelling activities.


      All the rooms at Utopia include a terrace with a garden view. Each one offers
      a satellite TV, outdoor furniture and a fridge. The bathroom is fitted with
      a bath or a shower.


      Guests can enjoy an energizing workout at the gym, followed by relaxation time
      at the spa. An array of activities can be enjoyed at the property including
      tennis and darts.
